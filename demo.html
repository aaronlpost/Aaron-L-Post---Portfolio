            	<img class="left" src="/assets/img/beth-about.jpg">
				<p class="right">When Beth approached me with a request for her own site, it had been several years since I had designed my first production site for my <a href="http://www.artietheclown.com">father</a>. A lot had changed on the web over that period of time. After graduating from college in 2009 I started to brush up on my coding and design skills. My own site had always been a personal playground for the new skills I was learning. Beth&#8217;s site provided a platform to design for an actual client. It was time to get my feet wet. </p>
			</section>
			<section class="brief half clearfix">
            	<img class="right" src="/assets/img/beth-less.jpg">
				<p class="left">For a more rapid development process, and to quench my everlasting thirst to learn something new, I turned to <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> to act as the foundation. (Speaking of foundations, I also tinkered with an alternate framework, <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">ZURB Foundation</a>.) Bootstrap introduced me to <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> and the concept of CSS preprocessors in general. Although in retrospect the produced code looks admittedly bloated (the complexity of Bootstrap wasn&#8217;t <em>necessary</em> for such a small site), I still learned a ton about emerging web design tools. </p>
			</section>
			<section class="center brief">
            	<img src="/assets/img/beth-responsive.png">
				<p>The site was designed from the start to be responsive. Visitors at a gallery showing are able to check out more of Beth&#8217;s work on mobile devices, then see more detail at home on a larger monitor. This design provided a valuable opportunity for me to learn about media queries on the backend, and flexible user interface design on the frontend. I&#8217;ve been fascinated by the design opportunities since. I love solving puzzles, and crafting experiences according to users&#8217; device of choice is one giant puzzle worth exploring. </p>
			</section>
			<section class="brief half clearfix">
				<p class="right">Since the initial design was fleshed out in Bootstrap and consisted of static files, any updates had to be done through code. Beth wanted a frictionless way to add more content. I wanted a frictionless way to control design. <a href="http://statamic.com/">Statamic</a> provided both. Not having to fiddle with a database and (much) PHP allowed me to focus on what I wanted to learn most: design through HTML and CSS. Statamic allowed me to experiment to my heart&#8217;s content with design first and drop in a few variables later to automate content management. </p>
