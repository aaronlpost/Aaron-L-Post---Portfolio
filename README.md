[AaronLPost.com](http://AaronLPost.com) is my personal portfolio, grand experiment, and playground to try out new code. This is where I create, break, design, break some more, and learn learn learn.

 The backend is powered by [Statamic](http://www.statamic.com) and the frontend is based on [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com) and SASS. Statamic app code has been removed due to licensing. My content and code has been preserved with Statamic tags.
 
 [This](http://www.statamic.com/learn/core-concepts/how-pages-are-built) will give you an idea of how pages are built in Statamic. The bulk of my custom code can be found in the [SASS](https://github.com/aaronlpost/Aaron-L-Post---Portfolio/tree/hookem/_themes/rikki-tikki/sass), [JS](https://github.com/aaronlpost/Aaron-L-Post---Portfolio/tree/hookem/_themes/rikki-tikki/js), [Layouts](https://github.com/aaronlpost/Aaron-L-Post---Portfolio/tree/hookem/_themes/rikki-tikki/layouts), and [Templates](https://github.com/aaronlpost/Aaron-L-Post---Portfolio/tree/hookem/_themes/rikki-tikki/templates) folders.
